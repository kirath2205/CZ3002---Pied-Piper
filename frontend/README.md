# VolunteerGoWhere

This repo contains the frontend code for the VolunteerGoWhere application.

## Setting up the development Environment

Make sure you have yarn installed.

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

To install all the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

To start the frontend application, run the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Next.js has [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) enabled, so you don't need to restart the dev server everytime you update the code, just hit Save (Ctrl + S).
